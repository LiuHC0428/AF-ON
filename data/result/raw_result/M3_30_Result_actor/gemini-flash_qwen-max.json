It's caused by wear and tear on the cartilage that cushions the bones in the joint.  The X-ray shows some narrowing of the joint space and bone spurs, which are both signs of osteoarthritis.  \n\nI'm going to prescribe some pain relievers and recommend some exercises to help strengthen the muscles around your thumb.  You may also want to consider using a splint or brace to support your thumb and reduce pain.  If your pain doesn't improve with these treatments, we can discuss other options, such as injections or surgery.  \n\nIt's important to keep your thumb moving as much as possible, even if it hurts.  This will help to keep the joint flexible and prevent further damage.  You should also avoid activities that put stress on your thumb, such as heavy lifting or repetitive motions.  \n\nI hope this helps.  Please let me know if you have any questions. \n",

She denies any abdominal pain, discomfort, or changes in bowel habits other than the color of her stool. She also reports feeling fatigued and worn out. \n\n**Past Medical History:**\n\n* No significant past medical history reported.\n\n**Social History:**\n\n* No recent travel or unusual exposures.\n* No recent dietary changes.\n\n**Review of Systems:**\n\n* **Gastrointestinal:** Dark stools, fatigue.\n* **Constitutional:** Fatigue.\n\n**Physical Examination:**\n\n* Not reported in the dialogue.\n\n**Investigations:**\n\n* Blood tests ordered to check iron levels and signs of internal bleeding.\n\n**Results:**\n\n* Blood tests were normal.\n\n**Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n* **Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding:** The most likely diagnosis given the patient's presentation of dark, tarry stools. This could be caused by various factors such as peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, esophageal varices, or malignancy.\n* **Iron Deficiency Anemia:** While the blood tests were normal, iron deficiency anemia can present with fatigue and dark stools.\n* **Other Causes:**  Other less likely causes include medications, food dyes, and certain foods.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\n* Pending further investigation, the most likely diagnosis is **Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding**.\n\n**Treatment Plan:**\n\n* **Further Investigation:**  Given the normal blood test results, further investigation is necessary to determine the source of the bleeding. This may include:\n    * **Upper Endoscopy:** To visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract and identify any potential sources of bleeding.\n    * **Stool Studies:** To check for occult blood in the stool.\n* **Symptom Management:**  The patient should be advised to monitor her symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if she experiences any worsening of her symptoms, such as increased fatigue, abdominal pain, or vomiting blood.\n\n**Prognosis:**\n\nThe prognosis for the patient will depend on the underlying cause of the bleeding. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications.\n\n**Follow-up:**\n\nThe patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of further investigations and to develop a personalized treatment plan. \n"

The fact that your bilirubin levels and liver function tests are normal suggests that the leak is not causing significant liver damage yet.\n\nWe need to treat this leak to prevent further complications.  The most common treatment is endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a procedure where a thin, flexible tube is inserted through your mouth and into your bile duct.
