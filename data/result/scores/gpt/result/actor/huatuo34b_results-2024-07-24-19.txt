Notes:
- The consultation is generally logical and clear, and most key medical history details were collected, but not completely as changes in urine and stool color were omitted in the summary.
- The doctor did not explicitly perform or record the necessary examination (abdominal ultrasound) in the summarized case, thus scoring very low in this category.
- Communication was good, clear, and the doctor effectively reassured the patient, making understanding easier.
