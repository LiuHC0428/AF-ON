case:12


Diagnosis score: 2. 
Various indicators suggest the patient has purulent tenosynovitis. However, the doctor diagnosed it as cellulitis, which indicates an understanding of infectious conditions but a distinct diagnosis from the accurate one per the case info.

Treatment score: 3. 
The suggested oral antibiotics and other measures might somewhat help with infection-related issues such as cellulitis, but would not adequately address purulent tenosynovitis, which requires surgical intervention like incision and drainage of abscess and nail extraction.

case:22


Diagnosis score: 3.5  
The doctor identified multiple rib fractures and a left-sided pneumothorax but indicated a possible pneumonia or respiratory infection, which was not part of the standard diagnosis in the 'case info'.

Treatment score: 4.0  
The treatment proposed includes antibiotic administration, which aligns with the need for infection management stated in 'case info'. The doctor's treatment plan also includes a chest tube for pneumothorax, which is appropriate. However, the detailed treatment specifics such as nil by mouth and fluid replenishment are not explicitly mentioned.
