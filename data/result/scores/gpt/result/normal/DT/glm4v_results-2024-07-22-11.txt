Diagnosis score 
The doctor completely missed the diagnosis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis and instead suggested possible gastritis or duodenitis. The findings on the CT scan should have pointed towards a more severe condition, which in this case was pancreatitis.

Treatment:
The proposed treatment plan of dietary modifications and referral to a gastroenterologist is insufficient for a condition as critical as acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Appropriate immediate interventions like antibiotics, immune modulation, and mechanical ventilation were not considered.
