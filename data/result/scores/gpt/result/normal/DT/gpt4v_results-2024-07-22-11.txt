case:2


**Diagnosis score: 3.8**
- The doctor's differential diagnosis includes the exacerbation of gastric ulcers, pancreatitis, and cholecystitis, which are reasonable but misses the correct primary diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal perforation noted in the case info. The mention of other considerations is valid but lacks specific alignment with the perforation.

**Treatment score: 3.8**
- The doctor's recommendation of immediate management with dietary modifications and symptomatic relief, along with scheduling diagnostic tests, is appropriate but not optimal. The accurate treatment should directly address the upper gastrointestinal perforation, possibly requiring urgent surgical consultation or intervention beyond the suggested conservative and diagnostic approach.

case:11


**Diagnosis score: 4.4**
- The doctor correctly identified gastric ulcer but missed confirming gastric perforation. The provided diagnosis is close but not entirely consistent with the benchmark.

**Treatment score: 2.5**
- The doctor recommended appropriate preliminary examinations and planned for medical management of a gastric ulcer. However, the indicated treatment plan did not include the necessary surgical repair of gastric ulcer perforation and abdominal lavage with drainage, which is crucial for this case.
