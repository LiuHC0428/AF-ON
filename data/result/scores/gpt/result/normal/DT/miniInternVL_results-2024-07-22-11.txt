**Diagnosis score: 3.4** 
While the doctor correctly identified rib fractures, they missed the important findings from the CT scans mentioned in the case info, such as left-sided pneumohydrothorax, and effusions. The note about possible spleen injury is speculative without addressing the abdominal effusion more definitively.

**Treatment score: 3.5**  
The treatment plan provided by the doctor in the dialogue primarily focuses on referral and advising pain management. The case info calls for more immediate intervention, including nil by mouth, fluid replenishment, antibiotics, and nutritional support, which are not mentioned in the doctor's plan. Therefore, the treatment provided is helpful but not optimal.
