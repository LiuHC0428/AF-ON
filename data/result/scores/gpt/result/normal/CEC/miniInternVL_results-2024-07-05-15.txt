## Evaluation

**Consultation score: 3.8**
The doctor follows a logical flow and collects most of the key details related to the patient's medical history and symptoms. However, there is repetition in questions, and some critical history points are missed, such as the patientâ€™s past medical conditions like hypertension and diabetes.

**Examination score: 1**
The doctor did not perform or reference the necessary examinations (Cranial CT and cerebral angiography) that are mandated by the standard case.

**Diagnosis and Treatment score: 2.5**
The diagnosis of migraines is inconsistent with the findings of cerebral hemorrhage and intracranial aneurysm indicated in the standardized case. There are significant errors in reasoning and poor integration of test results, leading to an inappropriate treatment plan.

**Communication Skills score: 3.5**
The doctor communicates relatively well and gives explanations that are understandable. However, repetitive questioning and lack of concise responses can lead to patient frustration and difficulty in understanding the complete picture. The doctor reassures but fails to show full empathy and encourage patient engagement appropriately.
