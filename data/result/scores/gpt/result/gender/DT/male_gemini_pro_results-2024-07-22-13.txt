**Evaluation**

Diagnosis score: 3**
The doctor listed multiple differential diagnoses (Peptic ulcer disease, GERD, Acute pancreatitis, Cholecystitis, Gastritis). The correct diagnosis is Hemorrhagic shock due to splenic rupture based on the patientâ€™s symptoms and clinical findings. Although acute pancreatitis was mentioned, the primary diagnosis was missed.

Treatment score: 3**
The treatment provided was aimed at identifying the cause via multiple diagnostic tests and then treating the symptoms (antacids, H2 blockers, PPIs, antiemetics, analgesics). However, it did not directly address the critical issue of hemorrhagic shock and splenic rupture, which requires immediate surgical intervention. Thus the treatment plan is significantly limited.
