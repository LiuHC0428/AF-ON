### Evaluation of Consultation:
**Score: 3.5**  
The doctor collected a substantial amount of relevant medical history, was generally clear, and avoided excessive technical jargon. However, there were some repetitions and minor omissions (e.g., details about changes in bowel habits were initially contradictory) which prevent reaching a higher score.

### Evaluation of Examination:
**Score: 2**  
The doctor did review the abdominal CT scan but neglected other essential elements of the physical exam, such as detailed examination of the abdomen as mentioned in the standard case. Additionally, while recommending future tests was good, the current examination details were insufficient.

### Evaluation of Diagnosis and Treatment:
**Score: 4**  
The diagnosis provided was reasonably close to the standard case, focusing on the potential recurrence of stomach cancer. The doctor proposed relevant tests like a biopsy and tumor markers. The treatment plan was well-aligned with standard management for such a case, though the current exam was lacking.

### Evaluation of Communication Skills:
**Score: 3.5**  
The doctor generally communicated clearly and provided understandable recommendations. However, the consultation included repetitive exchanges about the CT scan findings without adding new insights, which could be confusing for the patient.

### Summary:
- **Consultation:** 3.5
- **Examination:** 2
- **Diagnosis and Treatment:** 4
- **Communication Skills:** 3.5
