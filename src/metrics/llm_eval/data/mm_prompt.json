        "prompt":"Below are two different conversations between a doctor and a patient regarding the same medical case. In the first scenario, the patient provides the examination images to the doctor for interpretation and analysis. In the second scenario, the patient provides the interpreted examination results to the doctor for analysis. Considering second scenario as benchmark, your task is to evaluate the  doctor's performance in following two aspects and provide ratings for each aspect on a scale of 1 to 5 at the beginning in format: 'score: x'. For cases where the criteria for corresponding scores are not fully met, one can take the decimal between them. And you don't need to give any explanation. Use the following scale to evaluate each criterion:\ntotal behaviors:\nscore 1: Compared to the benchmarks, there is a very large gap between the doctor's performance and the diagnosis of the disease, e.g., the conclusions given are very different, etc.\nscore 2: Compared to benchmarks, there are relatively large gaps in the performance and diagnosis of conditions by doctor.\nscore 3: Compared to benchmarks, there is a degree of discrepancy in the performance and diagnosis of conditions by doctor, but this does not have a very negative impact on subsequent treatment.\nScore 4: Compared to benchmarks, there are small gaps in doctor's performance and diagnosis of conditions.\nScore 5: Compared to benchmarks, doctor's performance and analyses of test results  were almost identical in terms of diagnosis of conditions  \nExamination image analysis capabilities: \nscore 1: Compared to examination results in benchmarks, there is a very large gap between the doctor's analysis of the examination image, e.g., the conclusions given are very different, etc.\nscore 2: Compared to examination results in benchmarks, there is a large gap between the doctor's analysis of the examination image.\nscore 3: Compared to examination results in benchmarks, there are some diffrences between the doctor's analysis of the examination image, but the conclusions are similar.\nscore 4; Compared to examination results in benchmarks, there are small gaps between the doctor's analysis of the examination image.\nscore 5: Compared to examination results in benchmarks, doctor's analysis of the examination image were almost identical\n\nAttention: provide ratings for each aspect on a scale of 1 to 5 at the beginning in format: 'score: x'"

        "prompt":"You are a strict evaluator. Below are two conversations between a doctor and a patient under different circumstances, both referring to the same case. The first conversation is when the patient provides examination results to the doctor, and the second conversation is when the patient does not provide examination results to the doctor. Your task is to compare the two situations and analyze whether the diagnosis accuracy and comprehensive capability are better in the case with image input than without image input. Then, give a rating from 1 to 5 at the beginning in format: 'score: x'. For cases where the criteria for corresponding scores are not fully met, one can take the decimal between them. You don't need to give any explanation. Use the following scale to evaluate each criterion:\nscore 1: Compared with no image input, the input of pictures did not help the doctor's diagnosis, i.e., the doctor's diagnosis was very similar to the perception in both cases\nscore 2: Compared with no image input, the input of pictures brings little help to the doctor's diagnosis.\nscore 3: Compared with no image input, the input of pictures brings some help to the doctor's diagnosis. e.g., the picture information makes the doctor more aware of the patient's situation but is not critical.\nscore 4: Compared with no image input, the input of pictures brings a lot of help to the doctor's diagnosis. e.g., the picture information makes the doctor more aware of the patient's situation.\nscore 5: Compared with no image input, the input of pictures brings very critical help to the doctor's diagnosis. e.g. the picture information allows the doctor to have a very deep understanding of the patient's situation."
