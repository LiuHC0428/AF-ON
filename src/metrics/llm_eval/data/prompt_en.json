        "prompt" : "You are a strict evaluator. Below, a case will be presented, which has been divided into three modules: case info, dialogue, and case by doctor. Your task is to evaluate the consultation, examination and communication skills based on the following evaluation criteria. Provide ratings for each aspect on a scale of 1 to 5 at the beginning in format: 'score: x'. In this case, the case info is the standard case content, which you should consider as a reference answer and use it as a benchmark to evaluate the conversation with the case summarized by the doctor. For cases where the criteria for corresponding scores are not fully met, one can take the decimal between them. You don't need to give any explanation or repeat my input. Use the following scale to evaluate each criterion:\nConsultation\nscore 1: The doctor's logic is confused, questions are unreasonable, and language is obscure with excessive medical jargon. Medical history collection is incomplete and lacks details.\nscore 2: The doctor has some logic but still makes unreasonable arrangements and uses obscure language with medical terms. Medical history collection is incomplete with missing key points.\nscore 3: The doctor has some logic with fewer unreasonable arrangements, speaks more fluently with less jargon, and collects most key medical history details.\nscore 4: The doctor is logical and clear, focuses on key issues, avoids jargon, and collects a complete medical history.\nscore 5: The doctor is very clear and logical, focuses on key issues, avoids jargon entirely, and collects a fully complete medical history.\nExamination\nscore 1: The doctor performs no valid tests (i.e., the tests in the 'Examination' item in the standard case) and prescribes highly unnecessary tests.\nscore 2: The doctor performed the tests in the 'Examination' item in the standard case but some additional tests are unnecessary, with significantly inaccurate interpretations.\nscore 3: The doctor performed the tests in the 'Examination' item in the standard case but with a few unnecessary ones, and has somewhat inaccurate interpretations.\nscore 4: The doctor performed the tests in the 'Examination' item in the standard case but very few unnecessary ones, and slightly inaccurate interpretations.\nscore 5: The doctor performs all necessary tests with reasonable prescriptions and virtually error-free interpretations.\nAttention: if doctor doesn't perform the examination in the 'Examination' item in the standard case, the score should be 1. \nCommunication Skills\nscore 1: The doctor has poor communication skills, gives unclear answers, and fails to reassure or encourage patients, making it difficult for patients to understand the situation.\nscore 2: The doctor has poor communication skills, gives complicated answers, and weakly reassures patients, making understanding difficult.\nscore 3: The doctor's communication skills are average, with slightly complicated answers and weak reassurance, making understanding somewhat difficult.\nscore 4: The doctor communicates well, gives clear answers, and effectively reassures patients, making understanding easier.\nscore 5: The doctor communicates excellently, gives clear and concise answers, effectively reassures and encourages patients, and shows empathy.\n\nAttention:provide ratings for each aspect on a scale of 1 to 5 at the beginning in format: 'score: x'"

Your task is to evaluate doctor's diagnosis and treatment skill based on the following evaluation criteria. Provide ratings for each aspect on a scale of 1 to 5 at the beginning in format: 'score: x'. In this case, 'case info' is  standard case content, which you should consider as a reference answer and use it as a benchmark to evaluate the conversation and the case summarized by the doctor.

Use the following scale to evaluate each criterion:\nDiagnosis\nConsider item 'Diagnosis' in the 'case info' as the standard diagnosis answer\nscore 1: The doctor is unable to provide a correct primary diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and it's far from the answer. e.g., pancreatitis is diagnosed as a heart attack\nscore 2: The doctor provides a diagnosis that is completely inconsistent withthe answer, but the deviation is small, as when tonsillitis is diagnosed as bronchitis..\nscore 3: The doctor provides a diagnosis with minor discrepancies from the answer, but the organ of pathogenesis is correctly diagnosed, e.g., gastric ulcer is diagnosed as gastritis.\nscore 4: The doctor provides a diagnosis that is close to the answer but there are some minor errors that are difficult to distinguish, such as influenza A being diagnosed as influenza B.  \nscore 5: The doctor provides a diagnosis that is consistent with the answer.\nTreatment\nConsider item 'Treatment' in the 'case info' as the standard diagnosis answer\nscore 1: The doctor is unable to provide a reasonable treatment plan, or it's far from the answer. e.g., only painkillers are needed but doctor decides to perform surgery.\nscore 2: The doctor's treatment plan does not resolve the patient's condition, but it also does not cause additional damage to patient, such as the need for doxycycline injections but  doctor decides to inject saline\nscore 3: The doctor's treatment plan is very limited to help the patient's condition, for example, patient needs surgery but the doctor only uses painkillers\nscore 4: The doctor's treatment is helpful but not optimal for the patient's condition, e.g., patient needs amoxicillin injections but the doctor chooses sulfonamide\nscore 5: The doctor provides a treatment that is consistent with the answer.\n\nAttention:provide ratings for each aspect on a scale of 1 to 5 at the beginning in format: 'score: x'"

For cases where the criteria for corresponding scores are not fully met, one can take the decimal between them. You don't need to give any explanation or repeat my input. Use the following scale to evaluate each criterion:\nScore 1: The doctor's dialogue is disorganized and questions are asked in an arbitrary order. The purpose of questioning is vague and unfocused. The diagnostic process is arbitrary and there's an inability to process the obtained information.\nScore 2: The doctor's dialogue is poorly organized with flaws in the questioning sequence logic. The purpose and focus of questioning are unclear. The diagnostic process is poorly logical.\nScore 3: The doctor's dialogue has minor logical flaws, such as poor sequentiality, and some flaws in the questioning sequence logic. The purpose and focus of questioning are present but poorly organized. The diagnostic process is poorly logical.\nScore 4: The organization of the doctor's dialogue is relatively perfect, with no inconsistencies. There are no problems with the order of questioning that affect the consultation logic. The purpose and focus of questions are present and well organized. The diagnostic process is logical.\nScore 5: The doctor is well organized and asks questions in order. Questioning is purposeful and focused. Diagnosis is gradual, and the obtained information can be processed correctly."
